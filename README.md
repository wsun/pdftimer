# pdftimer

Simple HTML page for displaying a PDF with timer

https://github.com/wsun/pdftimer/main.html

This page will display a PDF file you have locally - just click "Load PDF". The PDF is not uploaded anywhere. A timer is available at the bottom-right of the screen - it defaults to 10 minutes, but can be adjusted.
